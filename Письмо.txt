Nizhny NovgorodRussia09/11/2020Dear Joanna,Thanks a lot for your letter. It’s great to hear from you again! Sorry I haven’t written to you for so long as I’ve been busy at school. In your letter you asked me about making friends in a new school. Well, you should make the first step and say «Hi» to your classmates. As for me, it was easy to make friends in my new school. Confidence helps me to start the conversation first. I think you should join school clubs as you can meet new people and make friends there. By the way, how long have you been in Venice? What places have you visited there? Who did you travel with?Actually, I’ve got to go now as I’ve a lot of homework to do. Take care and keep in touch!Love,Mary
